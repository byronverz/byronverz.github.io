# Data is Not the Next Oil
#### Byron Verzmoter
If you work in any technology focused industry or pay attention to the development of technologies, 
you’ve probably heard the phrase “data is the next oil”. It was originally coined by Clive Humby back 
in 2006 when he was in marketing at Tesco. The mathematician, unknowingly, would not only predict, 
but perhaps frame the data boom in a way that draws the ambitious and greedy alike. The analogy made it 
easy to understand how data could make organizations and people wealthier, and how it could increase control. 
Now I am in no way implying that Mr. Humby is to blame for the unscrupulous developments that has plagued 
much of Big Tech, simply that the phrase has played the role of the scapegoat for many a nefarious character. 

So, is data the next oil? No. At least I hope the world and technology leaders do not limit it to the primitive 
industrialisations of oil or any physical resource for that matter. First, let us address what most articles 
that focus on this quote, just for a bit of background. The quality of data is massively important. Having 
petabytes of customer data is useless if it cannot be processed and understood, either by a human or nowadays, 
by some algorithmic modelling. This is why data infrastructure and developments in data management have grown 
so massively. Just look at the scope of offerings from AWS, Azure or Google Cloud for data reporting and storage
 and have a look at when these frankly saturated products groups came to be. I believe a large reason for this 
 is the analogy. Raw oil is useless, so we need refineries and data followed suit. This part of the analogy, 
 the most simple and obvious relation, plays nicely in the minds of business leaders as it should, it makes 
 sense. But let’s get into why data is not the next oil because it really is so much more complex.
 
The most obvious starting point when speaking about data is privacy. As a younger person who is perhaps expected 
to give up all my privacy and data for an Instagram feed and momentary hits of dopamine, I like to think I am 
more conscious of the impacts and invasions of data collection than most in my generation. For starters I do 
not believe the trade of addiction for private data is a fair one and most people would agree, however, it is
one made billions of times every day. So, in that sense, data is also like oil but instead of raping the earth
when we take oil out of the ground and then suffocating it when we burn it, we invade the privacy of users to
gather data and then give them addiction and mental health issues when we use the data. These two steps alone 
should illustrate how much more complex the data problem is compared to oil. There are essentially as many unique 
impacts and possible issues that could stem from immoral data collection and usage as there are users of the service.
   
The discussion around data privacy and the impact on data collection and usage will probably live on in the zeitgeist
 for many more years to come, but it emphasises the point in the first paragraph. The framing of data as oil has 
 perhaps led us to repeat the same mistakes, or at least live within the limitations of the model.
 
The next point that is not spoken about enough is ownership. Currently, most countries that want to stick with the 
times have published acts or regulations stating you own the personal data you generate; however, service providers 
ultimately have control over that data. This could mean selling your data, allowing governments and law enforcement 
to peer into what you generate without your knowing and often without any probable cause. So, do you really own it 
if you cannot refuse these use cases? This point can really expand into multiple pages, so instead I implore you to
ponder on the idea of “owning your data” and if you truly do feel like you own the location data you generate 
every day, or your browsing habits, or even your Facebook chats. So how does the idea of ownership mean data
is different to oil? Well, in an ideal world, where you do actually own your data as you should, you should be 
allowed to refuse any use case at any time, so there is a volatility that affects the amount and quality of data
collected even once it is in use. In this ideal world, how do you ensure your users aren’t suddenly going to 
refuse your use of location data and render your navigation service useless compared to your competition? Trust.
There exists a relationship between the data generator and the data custodian that must be maintained at every
point of the data lifecycle. This relationship not only ensures moral use practices, but also fair trade between
users and providers. The distancing of those who are in control of data collection technologies and the users
has facilitated the disconnectedness and moral ambiguity many Big Tech organisations now practice, however,
with these ideal world practices in place, data collection and use could actually improve the lives of everyone.
        
Lastly, and perhaps the most important point, reuse and sharing. Once oil is taken out of the ground, refined and 
whatever final form is burnt away or made into some plastic, that’s it. But data can be reused as many times as 
there are ideas in your head to use it. Now this could mean that at some point, the value of data will go down since
it never gets used up and we effectively have an infinite supply. But we also have a theoretically infinite demand, 
but only if we share. Now, it would be easy to argue that data can become outdated and useless so there exists some
rate of decay for data that we could equate to the burning of oil, but I disagree. I think for as long as there are
people with ideas, data generated at any point in time can be useful. The fact that data can be transformed into
multiple forms and used without being destroyed makes it more like the very matter that oil is made of than the oil itself.

Timothy Morton posed this idea of hyperobjects when discussing the problem of global warming in The Ecological Thought
and I believe that data fits the notion of a hyperobject quite well. It is inescapable, massively interconnected, and 
will persist beyond the comprehension of human lifetimes. Data isn’t the next oil because it is so much more.
